# the_b0xx: internet television you control

Built under the working assumption that [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) + [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com/) + [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) *effectively* = [The Box](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Box_(US_TV_channel\)). Or, at the very least, could make a neat projector display for my Halloween party.

This is my first node app. Please be gentle.
